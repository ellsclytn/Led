**My explorations into controlling an addressable LED strip**

## Usage

Arduino code is based off Jake Bergamin's guide on how to [Make A WiFi Controllable LED Strip](http://jakebergamin.com/2016/02/08/wifi-led-strip/), and uses the accompanying [Android app](https://github.com/jbergamin/Android-LED-Strip).
